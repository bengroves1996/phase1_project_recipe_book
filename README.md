Welcome to the Modern Forager CLI application
You may notice that you require an API KEY to run this application. 
You can get one here: https://spoonacular.com/food-api
Create free account and get your proper spoonacular API KEY to run this application.

Once you have it go to the api.rb file, and replace it {ENV["API_KEY"]} with the key you got from spoonacular. 
Replacing that varibale will allow the application to run, so let's get right to it!
Type into your console 'ruby bin/run'. From there follow the prompts provided. 
Thank you for your time, and usage of the Modern Forager CLI application.
